Experiments with LPC1769 in preparation for the Climb-cubesats OBC software.

There is a repository Wbsite configured. The website is accessible at: https://carstenscharlemann.github.io/Climb-Obc-Sandbox
Here all commits of the /docs folder master branch are published.

Here is a Step by Step guide how to setup your developer pc: [Setup MCUXpresso](mddocs/HowTos/SetupMcuxpresso.md)

Have fun playing around.

For debugging this code assumes that you have connected the [LPCXpresso Board - OM13085](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/hardware-development-tools/lpcxpresso-boards/lpcxpresso-board-for-lpc1769-with-cmsis-dap-probe:OM13085)
